## Cathedral and Bazaar Comparison
The Cathedral model is when all development is hidden until is ready to be released. The Bazaar model is when development is public, and there's constant pushing to production. Whenever you see a bug, you make a change to the code and release it. If I had to pick between the two, then I would pick the Bazaar model. But honestly, I would like a mix of both. I don't think it's wise to keep everything open and exposed and make uncalculated releases - especially if you're working on a phone app. However, I don't think not beta testing is wise either. Both are pretty extreme, and I would like to avoid extremes.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Every good work of software starts by scratching a developerâ€™s personal itch.
The author was trying to say that software is built to solve problems. He made this email client because he wanted to solve a problem that him and many people cared about. A good way to get developers to work on software would be to make the software be a solution to something that they find annoying.

### Lesson 2: Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
He was saying that if there's already pre-written code out there that you could use then use it and maybe rewrite some of it for you purpose. You want to try to be "lazy". If you see code out there that does sort-of what you need then you should use it.
