### How I contributed and what it was

I thought of the most niche thing I know, and NYU MARL, the research institute that I am working for, was one of them. Many students and even professors had no idea it existed. Many people, including myself, were surprised that it was in Steinhardt since the school is not known for Computer Science. I tried to check if they had a Wikipedia page - they did not - and I checked if they were on the Steinhardt Wikipedia page - they are not. As a result, I decided to contribute to the Steinhardt Wikipedia page to include some information about MARL.
