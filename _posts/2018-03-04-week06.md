## Summary

We are working on Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter is a way to execute code in the browser while allowing one to revert statements, save commands, and share it with others. One of our strengths is that we are experienced with Javascript, the primary language of Jupyter. Another advantage is some of us are familiar with setting up dev environments and navigating code bases. A disadvantage is that most of us have not used it. We have decided to meet every Tuesday at 6:30pm-8:30pm

Our milestones include:
- Commenting on issues
- Claim non-code related issues
- Claim code related issues
- Review PRs

## Open Data Week

Events I am planning to attend:
- Data Through Design
- NYC Open Data Week @ NYU
