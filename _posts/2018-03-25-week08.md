## Contribution of the Week

Commented on Jupyter [1](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3335#issuecomment-374651847), [2](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3335#issuecomment-374791019).

## "Humanitarian"

I will use the project [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa/) as an example. It's a Python library for audio and music analysis. At first glance, it seems to have very little to do with humans. However, using the Merrian Webster definition of humanitarian, "relating to or characteristic of people who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people," perhaps it can be used in a humanitarian way. Maybe one might use it to analyze the city congestion with sound or track the migration patterns of animal, which can help us understand our world and how to improve it. So while an ~audio and music~ library may not seem humanitarian in nature, it can be used for humanitarian purposes.

## Team Project

I will try to work on [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2460).
