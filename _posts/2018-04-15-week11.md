## Contribution of the Week and Team Progress

[Made commits to fix documentation](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/notebook/commits/documentation)

Me and Rosa improved the documentation to add steps on (1) verifying the installation and (2) how to troubleshoot if notebook isn't properly installed. I added the troubleshooting part using my previous experience troubleshooting the installation.
