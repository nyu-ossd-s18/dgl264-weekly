## Contribution of the Week

[UR GURL GOT HER PR ON JUPYTER MERGED](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3494)

## Google's approach to Open Source

Google's approach to Open Source contributions sound very Google-y. It's what I expected basically.
It sounds difficult to contribute to for newbies because there's internal code that you're not allowed to see. I can imagine that it would be very difficult
for Open Source experts as well. Also signing the agreement sounds pretty scary because as we've learned, nobody reads the legal stuff. To be honest, I
  probably would not want to contribute to an Open Source project at Google.

## Code of Conduct

The benefits of this Code of Conduct is that it prevents people from being rude and mean to each other. I also believe that this is beneficial for newcomers
since it makes the people who manage the code base seem friendly and caring. I am a firm believer in having a code of conduct because it shows that you
care for the community who contribute to the code. By extension, Notebook has a Code of Conduct since it is part of the Jupyter family. You can view the
document [here](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md)
